      <h2>Get involved</h2>
      <p>We are currently looking for support in a number of areas.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Management Committee</strong> needs half a dozen volunteers to get involved with planning, fundraising, administration - including charity management - finance and book-keeping. Energy, enthusiasm and patience are the main requirements!</p>
      <p>The <strong>Grounds Committee</strong> is looking for volunteers to help with regular clearance, maintenance and planting sessions under the supervision of BCP’s regular maintenance staff. Initially we are looking at four working parties a year and you’d be welcome to all, or one, or just for a few hours. No experience necessary. Get fit, make friends and help beautify the Chine! What could be better?</p>
      <p>Please contact the Friends by completing the form below - telling us what would you like to do, any skills you have that might be relevant, and the amount of time you might be able to commit.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, email us directly at <strong><a href="mailto:friendsofbranksomechine@gmail.com" style="color: salmon">friendsofbranksomechine@gmail.com</a></strong>.</p>

        <p>We are working with the officers of BCP Council to agree the initial programme of works and their help and advice is gratefully acknowledged.<br>
          We are especially grateful to Councillor May Haines, and to John Sprackling of Branksome Parks and Canford Cliffs Residents Association,
          whose early support and continuing encouragement has been invaluable.
